# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Laravel application code lives in `app/`, with HTTP flow governed by `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyContentAccess.php` and `app/Http/Controllers/PageController.php`.
- Flat-file content resides in `resources/views/content`; add subdirectories to mirror URL segments.
- Routes are centralized in `routes/web.php`; assets and Vite entrypoints sit under `resources/`.
- Tests are in `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit`; static assets publish from `public/`.

## Architecture Overview
- Requests (e.g., `/contact`) resolve directly to matching Blade templates in `resources/views/content`.
- `VerifyContentAccess` middleware queries the Redis list generated by `app:update-content-list` to block unknown slugs.
- `PageController` renders approved views; no SQL database is required thanks to the flat-file content model.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `php artisan app:update-content-list` (or `podium art app:update-content-list` when using the Podium CLI): rescan Blade content and refresh the Redis-backed page registry.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow PSR-12 / Laravel defaults: 4-space indentation, snake_case config keys, PascalCase classes, camelCase methods.
- Use `php artisan pint` (Laravel Pint) before submitting PHP changes; rely on Tailwind defaults for CSS naming.
- Keep Blade view filenames lowercase-with-dashes to match clean URL slugs.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Write imperative, brief commit subjects (e.g., `Add contact page validation`) and include rationale in the body when needed.
- Reference related issues or tickets in PR descriptions; outline behavioral changes and include screenshots for UI work.
- Confirm the Redis content list has been rebuilt or explain why it is unnecessary.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Environment provisioning is handled by the Podium CLI; avoid committing `.env` or secrets.
- Restrict URLs to alphanumeric, slash, and dash segments—no periods, underscores, or query strings—to align with middleware checks.
- After modifying content or middleware, rebuild caches (`php artisan config:clear`, `php artisan app:update-content-list`) to keep Redis entries synchronized.
